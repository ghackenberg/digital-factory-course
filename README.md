# Digital Factory Course Introduction

This course introduces you to the topics of **Digital Factory** and **Computer Simulation**. The course consists of two parts. The first part provides a theoretical introduction into the field and explains relevant terms. In the second part you learn building material flow simulations with the discrete event simulation software JaamSim.
